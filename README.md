# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

Stereo version of LSD-SLAM

> LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct
> (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale,
> semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
> [http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
> where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some
> example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.
